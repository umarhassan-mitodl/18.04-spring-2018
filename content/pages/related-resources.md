The [Differential Equations Applets](http://web.mit.edu/jorloff/www/jmoapplets/applets.html) page is an extensive collection of applets including:

*   MIT Mathlets
*   Applets used in _18.02 Calculus_
*   Applets used in _18.03 Differential Equations_
*   Java applets

Most of the Java applets have been converted to double-clickable applications, in case you have trouble running the applets in your browser.
